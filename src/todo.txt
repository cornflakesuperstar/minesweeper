things to fix:

current loading time (b4 implementing pre-loaded images)
38 seconds

afterwards:
5 seconds =]
--------------

IE ver 5 bug list -
-------------------
wouldnt fire mouseevents on other components (JKButtons) whilst one is pressed
have to pack the frame twice (??)

- check i am not calling init() twice (the sound files are being loaded twice)
- implement custom board
- implement help
- save some sound files at the right compression for an applet
- when the game is won, put flags on any unflagged bombs
- take all the beginner, intermediate and expert knowledge out of Board and stick in Minesweeper (pass width,
  height and bombs down when creating boards)
- store the board location in a cookie (ie. window x and y ords)
- use javascript to set the parameters passed to the applet so that it can determine which event handling code
  to use based on the browser type
- try and get the loadImage method globalised somewhere (i think it's used all over the place).
  can try passing down a reference to the applet everywhere and using that
- see C:\jdk1.3\demo\jfc\Metalworks for an example of how to include HTML help files in my application
- try using the save as option of appletviewer to optimise the applet to avoid the init() method (saves as .ser). see java in a
  nutshell for reference.
- consider saving the state of the game when user leaves
  eg. write the board_type to a cookie or something
- create a status bar that shows the loading status
- put a note on the minesweeper HTML page that the beginner board is 8*8 as per win98 not 9*9 as per win2000

WEBPAGE
- create an animated gif background that imitates the matrix's scrolling green numbers

OBFUSCATESTRIPPER
- create a java gui that accepts file locations and strips whitespace from the
  files

PHOTO ALBUM
- create a photo album generator (generates js/htm/xml/xsl for photo albums)
